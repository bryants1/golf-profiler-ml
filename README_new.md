## Data Flow

### 1. Quiz Taking Flow
```
User Answer → Update Scores → ML Question Selection → Continue/Generate Profile
```

### 2. Profile Generation Flow
```
Final Answers → Find Similar Users → Generate Base Profile → ML Enhancement → Final Profile
```

### 3. Learning Flow
```

- Finds users with similar golf preferences
- Aggregates recommendations from similar users
- Applies user-specific weights and adjustments

### Adaptive Learning
- Continuously improves question effectiveness
- Updates recommendation accuracy based on feedback
- Adjusts model weights based on performance

## Implementation Details

### Browser Storage Strategy
The system uses localStorage for demo purposes, but is designed to easily switch to backend storage:

```javascript
// Current (localStorage)
localStorage.setItem('golf_profiler_training_data', JSON.stringify(data));

// Production (would be)
await fetch('/api/training-data', { method: 'POST', body: JSON.stringify(data) });
```

### Performance Optimization
- Lazy loading of ML components
- Batch processing of feedback
- Efficient similarity calculations
- Caching of frequent operations

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallbacks to rule-based systems
- Comprehensive error logging
- Data validation and sanitization
- Recovery from corrupted data

## Usage Examples

### Basic Integration
```javascript
// Initialize ML service
const mlService = new MLService();

// Generate enhanced profile
const profile = await mlService.generateProfile(answers, scores, sessionId);

// Get next question with ML
const nextQuestion = mlService.selectNextQuestion(answers, scores, questionBank, questionNumber);

// Collect feedback for learning
await mlService.collectFeedback(sessionId, { accuracy: 'very_accurate', helpful: true });
```

### Advanced Analytics
```javascript
// Get comprehensive ML statistics
const stats = mlService.getMLStatistics();

// Get user similarity insights
const insights = mlService.getUserSimilarityInsights(userScores);

// Export model data for backup
const exportData = mlService.exportModelData();
```

## Configuration Options

### Similarity Settings
```javascript
{
  SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD: 0.7,        // Minimum similarity for recommendations
  MAX_SIMILAR_PROFILES: 10,         // Maximum profiles to consider
  DIVERSIFICATION_FACTOR: 0.15      // Diversity vs accuracy trade-off
}
```

### Question Selection
```javascript
{
  MIN_QUESTIONS: 5,                 // Minimum questions before completion
  MAX_QUESTIONS: 7,                 // Maximum questions allowed
  UNCERTAINTY_THRESHOLD: 2,         // When to continue asking questions
  EFFECTIVENESS_WEIGHT: 2.0         // Weight for ML effectiveness scoring
}
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Deep Learning Integration**: Neural networks for complex pattern recognition
2. **Real-time Learning**: Immediate model updates from user interactions
3. **Advanced Clustering**: Market segmentation for targeted features

4. **Model Versioning**: Track and manage different model versions
5. **A/B Testing**: Framework for testing recommendation improvements

## Development & Testing

### Mock Data Generation
```javascript
// Generate test data for development
mlService.generateMockData(100);  // Creates 100 mock user profiles
```

### Data Management
```javascript
// Clear all data (development only)
mlService.clearAllData();

// Export for backup
const backup = mlService.exportModelData();

// Import from backup
await mlService.importModelData(backup);
```

### Health Monitoring
```javascript
// Check system health
const health = mlService.healthCheck();
// Returns: { initialized, version, dataHealth, performanceHealth }
```

## Privacy & Ethics

### Data Privacy
